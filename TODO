+ Start implementing the FUSE interface
The idea is that an application should mount a document and generate a tree
This will be useful for the future SVG editor as a way to debug what's going on on the tree
The user will be able to do shell scripts that will process the tree to for example find every
attribute and set a value, get the value on every moment, etc
